# Rust WebApi template

## Motivation
I was trying to use rust for my backend service,
but I couldn't find any template for it. So I stole some code from multiple 
repositories and managed to create something.

### Sources
- [Clean architecture rust](https://github.com/MSC29/clean-architecture-rust/tree/main)
- [Actix example](https://github.com/snamiki1212/realworld-v1-rust-actix-web-diesel)
